The website provides some statistics about mental illnesses to give the users a better understanding of the widespread issue and know that they are not alone. However, most people with mental illnesses do not seek treatment, most likely due to the stigma surrounding it. But, with Ivy, you can feel comfortable disucssing your situation and know that you won't be judged. Ivy can also suggest resources to help you learn more about your mental illness and ways to overcome it.
